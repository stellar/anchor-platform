This directory contains the Kubernetes manifests used to deploy SDF-hosted reference implementation of the Anchor Platform together with a sample Receiving Anchor Application.  

This includes:
- [reference-server](https://github.com/stellar/java-stellar-anchor-sdk/tree/main/anchor-reference-server) [config-map](reference-server-config-map.yaml), [deployment](reference-server-deployment.yaml), [ingress](reference-server-ingress.yaml), and [service](reference-server-service.yaml) manifests for an sample Receiving Anchor application integrated with the deployed Anchor Platform.

# Validation Testing
- [Anchor Validator](https://anchor-tests.stellar.org/) - You can run the Stellar Validation Test Suite against this deployment using the SDF Anchor Validation. Use HOME DOMAIN set to `https://anchor-sep-server-dev.stellar.org` and [sample config](https://github.com/stellar/java-stellar-anchor-sdk/blob/d972f7142fbfd3ca3ade3ea3b8edeacf1591ef11/platform/src/test/resources/stellar-anchor-tests-sep-config.json) to upload.
