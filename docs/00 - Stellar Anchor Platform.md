# Stellar Anchor Platform

The Anchor Platform is the easiest and fastest way to deploy a [SEP-compatible](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/tree/master/ecosystem) anchor service.
 
It implements the majority of standardized API (`SEP`) endpoints that wallets, exchanges, and other applications use, and provides a set of backend HTTPS APIs & callbacks for the anchor to integrate with for specifying fees, exchange rates, and off-chain transaction status updates.

The goal of the Anchor Platform is to abstract all Stellar-specific functionality and requirements for running an anchor, allowing businesses to focus on the core business logic necessary to provide these services.

## Getting Started

To get started, visit the [Anchor Platform documentation](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/category/anchor-platform).
