# Stellar Anchor Platform

The Anchor Platform is the easiest and fastest way to deploy a [SEP-compatible](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/tree/master/ecosystem) anchor service.
 
It implements a the majority of standardized API (`SEP`) endpoints that wallets, exchanges, and other applications use, and provides a set of backend HTTPS APIs & callbacks for the anchor to integrate with for specifying fees, exchange rates, and off-chain transaction status updates.

The goal of the Anchor Platform is to abstract all Stellar-specific functionality and requirements for running an anchor, allowing businesses to focus on the core business logic necessary to provide these services.

## Glossary

Here are the important terminology used in this project:

- **Anchor**: on/off ramps of the Stellar network. More information is available [here](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/anchoring-assets/).
- **Wallet**: a frontend application used to interact with the Stellar network on behalf of a user.
- **Sending Anchor**: a therminology used in the context of [SEP-31]. Refers to an entity that receives funds from a user and forwards it (after taking a fee) to a receiving anchor, in the SEP-31 `Sending Client->Sending Anchor->Receiving Anchor-> Receiving Client` flow.
- **Receiving Anchor**: a terminology used in the context of [SEP-31]. Refers to an entity that receives funds from a user and forwards it (after taking a fee) to a receiving client (or recipient), in the SEP-31 `Sending Client->Sending Anchor->Receiving Anchor-> Receiving Client` flow. This is what the Anchor Platform currently implements.
- **Ecosystem**: the community of entities and users that utilize the Stellar network and/or provide solutions on the Stellar network.
- **Anchor Platform (or Platform)**: the web application that will be exposing public endpoints and APIs. It is compliant with the [SEPs] to guarantee interoperability in the Stellar network and delegates business-specific logic to the Anchor Server.
- **Anchor Server**: a microservice that will be responsible for the Anchor-specific business logic used in the the Anchor Platform. This service interacts with the Anchor Platform to perform some actions like:
  - Calculate conversion rates between two assets.
  - Create or update a customer account.
  - Notify the Anchor about an incoming payment.
- **Callback API (`Sync Platform->Anchor`)**: a syncronous API that the Platform will use to gather a business-specific data from the Anchor Server, in order to perform a SEP-compliant operation (like exchange rate or user registration, for instance)
- **Events Queue (`Async Platform->Anchor`)**: an asyncronous communication venue that the Platform will use to notify the Anchor Server about a pending action, like an income payment that needs to be processed.
- **Platform API (`Sync Anchor->Platform`)**: a syncronous API that the Anchor can use to fetch information (e.g. transactions or quotes) and also update transactions stored in the Platform database.

## Microservices

In order to deploy this project, you'll need to have the following microservices running:

- **Database Server**: usually, you'll use a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, but we also support SQLite, commonly used in local development.
- **Queue Service**: we currently support [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/).
- **Anchor Platform Server**: this is the main application that will be providing public endpoints for your Anchor application.
- **Anchor Server**: this is the microservice that will be responsible for the Anchor-specific business logic used in the the Anchor Platform.

## Architecture

The following image shows the architecture of the Anchor Platform, as well as how it interacts with the Anchor Server and the Wallet/Client/Sending Anchor.

![img.jpeg](/docs/resources/img/anchor-platform-components-architecture.jpeg)

As you can see, the Anchor Platform receives interactions from ecosystem participants and deals with the interoperability part described in the SEPs. The Anchor Server is only called when there is a pending action to be performed.

This drastically reduces the amount of code that needs to be written by the Anchor, and allows them to focus on the business logic that's specific to their businesses and use cases.

## Subprojects

The Stellar Anchor SDK is a collection of projects that make easy to build financial applications on Stellar:

* [api-schema](/api-schema): the API interfaces, request, response classes.
* [core](/core): the base package for implementing standardized anchor applications.
* [payment](/payment): implementation of payment service with [Circle API](https://developers.circle.com/reference).
* [platform](/platform): the anchor platform [Spring Boot Application with WebMVC](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/).
* [anchor-reference-server](/anchor-reference-server): the reference implementation of the anchor server.
* [service-runner](/service-runner): the runner class for the platform, reference server and payment observer. 
* [integration-tests](/integration-tests): the integration tests for the platform, reference server, and payment observers.  

While the project is in its early stages and in active development, it is used in production today by businesses providing services on Stellar.
