# Stellar Anchor Platform

The Anchor Platform is the easiest and fastest way to deploy a [SEP-compatible](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/tree/master/ecosystem) anchor service.
 
It implements the majority of standardized API (`SEP`) endpoints that wallets, exchanges, and other applications use, and provides a set of backend HTTPS APIs & callbacks for the anchor to integrate with for specifying fees, exchange rates, and off-chain transaction status updates.

The goal of the Anchor Platform is to abstract all Stellar-specific functionality and requirements for running an anchor, allowing businesses to focus on the core business logic necessary to provide these services.

## Definitions

Here are the important terminology used in this project:

- **Anchor**: on/off ramps of the Stellar network. More information is available [here](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/anchoring-assets/).
- **Wallet**: a frontend application used to interact with the Stellar network on behalf of a user.
- **Sending Anchor**: a terminology used in the context of [SEP-31]. Refers to an entity that receives funds from a user and forwards it (after taking a fee) to a receiving anchor, in the SEP-31 `Sending Client->Sending Anchor->Receiving Anchor-> Receiving Client` flow.
- **Receiving Anchor**: a terminology used in the context of [SEP-31]. Refers to an entity that receives funds from a user and forwards it (after taking a fee) to a receiving client (or recipient), in the SEP-31 `Sending Client->Sending Anchor->Receiving Anchor-> Receiving Client` flow. This is what the Anchor Platform currently implements.
- **Ecosystem**: the community of entities and users that utilize the Stellar network and/or provide solutions on the Stellar network.
- **Anchor Platform (or Platform)**: the web application that will be exposing public endpoints and APIs. It is compliant with the [SEPs] to guarantee interoperability in the Stellar network and delegates business-specific logic to the Anchor Server.
- **Anchor Server**: a microservice that will be responsible for the Anchor-specific business logic used in the Anchor Platform. This service interacts with the Anchor Platform to perform some actions like:
  - Calculate conversion rates between two assets.
  - Create or update a customer account.
  - Notify the Anchor about an incoming payment.
- **Anchor Reference Server**: an Anchor Server implementation that is shipped as part of this repository for testing purposes.
- **Callback API (`Sync Platform->Anchor`)**: a synchronous API that the Platform will use to gather a business-specific data from the Anchor Server, in order to perform a SEP-compliant operation (like exchange rate or user registration, for instance)
- **Events Queue (`Async Platform->Anchor`)**: an asynchronous communication venue that the Platform will use to notify the Anchor Server about a pending action, like an incoming payment that needs to be processed.
- **Platform API (`Sync Anchor->Platform`)**: a synchronous API that the Anchor can use to fetch information (e.g. transactions or quotes) and also update the data of transactions stored in the Platform database.
- **[SEPs]**: it means Stellar Ecosystem Proposals and refers to standards that are used by Stellar ecosystem participants to achieve interoperability in the network. The ones implemented by this project are:
  | Standard |                                  Description                                   | Configurable | Interacts with Anchor Server | Supported by the Platform API | Supported by the SDK |
  | :------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :----------: | :--------------------------: | :---------------------------: | :------------------: |
  | [SEP-10] |                            Handles authentication.                             |     YES      |              NO              |              YES              |         YES          |
  | [SEP-12] |                                  Handles KYC.                                  |     YES      |             YES              |              YES              |         YES          |
  | [SEP-24] |       Handles deposit & withdrawal of assets in/out the Stellar network.       |     YES      |              NO              |              NO               |         YES          |
  | [SEP-31] | Used for international remittances. **Only the receiver side is implemented.** |     YES      |             YES              |              YES              |         YES          |
  | [SEP-38] |                Used for [rfq] **in conjunction with [SEP-31]**.                |     YES      |             YES              |              YES              |         YES          |

## Microservices

In order to deploy this project, you'll need to have the following microservices running:

- **Database Server**: usually, you'll use a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, but we also support SQLite, commonly used in local development.
- **Queue Service**: we currently support [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/).
- **Anchor Platform Server**: this is the main application that will be providing public endpoints for your Anchor application.
- **Anchor Server**: this is the microservice that will be responsible for the Anchor-specific business logic used in the Anchor Platform.

## Architecture

The following image shows the architecture of the Anchor Platform, as well as how it interacts with the Anchor Server and the Wallet/Client/Sending Anchor.

![img.jpeg](/docs/resources/img/anchor-platform-components-architecture.jpeg)

As you can see, the Anchor Platform receives interactions from ecosystem participants and deals with the interoperability part described in the SEPs. The Anchor Server is only called when there is a pending action to be performed.

This drastically reduces the amount of code that needs to be written by the Anchor, and allows them to focus on the business logic that's specific to their businesses and use cases.

## SEP-31 Flow

Here you can see the sequence diagram of the [SEP-31] flow, showing all the stakeholders, as well as the communication between Platform and Anchor Server. Please notice this flow includes quotes ([SEP-38]) but they may not be needed for your use-case:

> Note: in terms of database usage for SEP-31, our tests indicate that each SEP-31 (with SEP-38) transaction occupies ~2KB of space in the database. The tests also indicate the data space usage tends to decrease as the number of SEP-31 transactions increases. These results were achieved by executing 500 SEP-31 transactions on a Postgres database.
