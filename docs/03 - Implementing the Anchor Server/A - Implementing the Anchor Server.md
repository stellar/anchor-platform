In this section, we will cover how to implement the Anchor Server that interacts with the Anchor Platform.

Before proceeding with this document, please make sure you understand the project architecture and the definitions that are available on the [README.md](/README.md).

## Pre-requisites

* Properly [configure the Anchor Platform](/docs/01%20-%20Running%20%26%20Configuring%20the%20Application/A%20-%20Running%20%26%20Configuring%20the%20Application.md).
* Supply the services that will be used by the anchor platform, which include:
	* **Queue service**: the only supported ones as of this date are Kafka and SQS.
	* **Database**: this product has been tested with SQLite, Postgres and MySQL.
* Make sure the Platform points to the endpoint of your Anchor server.

## Testing Tools

* [`anchor-tests`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stellar/anchor-tests), a.k.a. Anchor Validator:
    * These are smoke tests that verify if the basics of the [SEPs] (interoperability protocols) are working correctly.
    * It can be run from the web interface (https://anchor-tests.stellar.org) or the [command line](https://github.com/stellar/java-stellar-anchor-sdk/blob/6a3db93ee0fb30dda3abaab79957c516bc9aa605/.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml#L90).
    * These tests depend on a successful integration between the Anchor Platform and your Anchor Server. This project shipped with an [Anchor Reference Server](/anchor-reference-server) that can be used for test purposes, but Anchors will be deploying their own Anchor Server containing their core business logic.
* Demo Wallet (https://demo-wallet.stellar.org):
	* The demo wallet can be used to test how a wallet (or Sending Anchor) will interact with your infrastructure.
	* It can be used to test the end-to-end [SEP-31] flow, where the Demo Wallet works like a Sending Anchor while the Platform is the Receiving Anchor.
	* Please be aware that the Demo Wallet does not use [SEP-38] quotes. To test them, please refer to the Python scripts below.
* [Python scripts](/end-to-end-tests/end_to_end_tests.py):
    * They contain end-to-end tests for [SEP-31] with and without [SEP-38].
    * The script takes the role of the Sending Anchor, testing the Platform role as a Receiving Anchor.

## Step-by-step Anchor Server Implementation

In this section, we cover the steps to build your Anchor Server, integrate it with the Platform and test the integration. We follow an incremental approach, where you start by deploying the Anchor Reference Server and running the tests with Platform + Anchor Reference Server, and then you will start developing your own server with your own business logic that will be used instead of the Anchor Reference Server.

For each new increment in functionality you add to your Anchor Server, there are apropriate tests that make sure your integration is compliant with the Platform and the [SEPs].

> Note: please consider the steps below are all on testnet. Weâ€™ll only explicitly suggest Public network in the latest step.

### Step 1 - Run the project with the Anchor Demo Server

### Step 2 - Implement Authentication

[SEP-10].
    
### Step 3 - Implement KYC

[SEP-12].
    
### Step 4 - Implement The Remmitances Receiving Party Without Quotes

[SEP-31]
    
If you need quotes, skip to step 5
    
### Step 5 - Implement RFR - Request for Quotation

[SEP-38]
    
### Step 6 - Implement The Remmitances Receiving Party With Quotes

[SEP-31] + [SEP-38]
    
### Step 7 - Make Sure All Tests Pass
    
### Step 8 - Experiment with the Public Network
