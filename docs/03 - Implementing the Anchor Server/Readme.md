# Implementing the Anchor Server

> Status: under development

In order to start using the Anchor Platform, there are 4 main steps:

1. Configure the Anchor Platform configuration files and environment variables.
2. Implement the Callback API and update the config files with the endpoint for the [Callback API].
3. Implement the event consumer service that's able to ingest the [Events Schema] from the queue service.
4. Implement a service that's able to reach out to the [Platform API] with the appropriate requests.

[Callback API]: Callbacks%20API.yml
[Events Schema]: Events%20Schema.yml
[Platform API]: Platform%20API.yml

More details on how to address these steps will be added later to this repo.
