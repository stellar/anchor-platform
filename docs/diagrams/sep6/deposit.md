### Deposit

This diagram illustrates how Anchors can provide deposit instructions to a user asynchronously. The flow starts after the user has authenticated with the anchor via SEP-10. The example here requires the user deposits fund to the Anchor's bank account, but the flow is similar for other deposit methods. The `deposit-exchange` flow works similarly, but the Platform will additionally verify the quote requested or make a call to the Fee integration to update amounts.

For more information on the deposit flow, see the [SEP-6](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0006.md) specification.
