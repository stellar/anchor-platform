<strong>Creating equitable access to the global financial system</strong>
<h1>Stellar Anchor SDK</h1>
</div>

The Stellar Anchor SDK is a collection of projects that make easy to build financial applications on Stellar.

* [core](./core) is the base package for implementing standardized anchor applications.
* [payment-circle](./payment-circle) is a package that wraps a subset of the [Circle API](https://developers.circle.com/reference).

While the project is in its early stages and in active development, it is used in production today by businesses providing services on Stellar.
